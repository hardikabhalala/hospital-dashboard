I’ve recently developed a Power BI Dashboard that provides actionable insights into healthcare data, focusing on improving patient outcomes and operational efficiency.
💡 Key Features:
•	🏥 Hospital Performance Metrics: Monitoring KPIs like medical cost, average treatment cost, room charges, insurance coverage.

•	📊 Cost Analysis: Breakdown of hospital expenses across departments like surgery, emergency, and inpatient care. 

•	Department wise charges: Visualized key patient data to identify trends and patterns

•	procedure cost: Analyzed data to identify cost of the different procedure.

•	city and state wise charges: Tracking city and sate wise total cost of the hospital charges.

Key learnings

•	Data cleaning and transformation using power query
•	Created date table by DAX measure
•	Calculated columns and advanced DAX calculation
•	split and merged column and changed the text typed date column
•	Bookmark and page navigation
•	Healthcare KPIs

With this dashboard, healthcare organizations can reduce unnecessary spending, improve operational efficiency, and ultimately enhance patient outcomes.
